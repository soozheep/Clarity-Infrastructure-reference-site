      <h1>Sonic Remedy</h1>

      <p class="lede">
        Auditory-based clarity regulation tools designed to reduce cognitive load,
        stabilise attention, and support internal signal recognition — without instruction,
        persuasion, or facilitation.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- ORIENTATION -->
    <div class="card content">
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Orientation</h2>
        <p>
          Sonic Remedy is a collection of sound-based works designed to support
          self-led clarity through auditory regulation rather than guidance or direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          The work does not attempt to explain, instruct, or motivate.
          Instead, it creates conditions in which internal signal recognition may
          become more accessible under cognitive load.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>The Problem Space</h2>
        <p>Modern cognitive environments are increasingly characterised by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>continuous information exposure</li>
          <li>fragmented attention</li>
          <li>decision fatigue and internal noise</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          While language-based tools are effective for reflection,
          they often compete with the same cognitive channels they seek to clarify.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>What Sonic Remedy Is</h2>
        <p>
          Sonic Remedy uses sound as a non-verbal medium for clarity regulation.
          It operates alongside — not within — narrative, instruction, or analysis.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>supports attentional stabilisation</li>
          <li>reduces cognitive interference</li>
          <li>allows meaning to emerge without directive framing</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>What Sonic Remedy Is Not</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>a therapeutic intervention</li>
          <li>a coaching or motivational tool</li>
          <li>a guided meditation system</li>
          <li>an audio narrative or instructional programme</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It does not prescribe outcomes or interpretations.
          Engagement remains self-directed and optional.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Structure of the Work</h2>
        <p>
          Sonic Remedy consists of multiple curated playlists,
          each operating as an independent auditory environment.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>no sequencing requirements</li>
          <li>no progression model</li>
          <li>no completion logic</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Listeners engage selectively, according to their own context and capacity.
        </p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Relationship to Clarity Infrastructure</h2>
        <p>
          Sonic Remedy functions as one operational pillar within the
          broader Clarity Infrastructure framework.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may be used independently or alongside other clarity-supporting
          modalities, without dependency or overlap.
        </p>

    <footer>
      Sonic Remedy is non-clinical, self-directed, and requires no facilitation.
